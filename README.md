This project uses Keras to implement a deep learning regression model for predicting house sale prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and location. The dataset used is the King County House Sales Prediction dataset from Kaggle, which includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015 in the Seattle area.

In addition to performing exploratory data analysis, this project focused heavily on feature engineering and cleaning the data to optimize model performance. The model was trained using various deep learning techniques, and ultimately achieved strong predictive accuracy.

The feature columns used in the model include the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage of living space and land, number of floors, and various other factors such as view quality and condition of the apartment. The project also includes visualization of the data using various techniques to better understand the relationships between features.

This project is a great example of how deep learning regression models can be used to predict house prices with high accuracy, and demonstrates the importance of feature engineering and cleaning in optimizing model performance.
